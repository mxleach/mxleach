### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Max Leach, and Iâ€™m a full-stack developer (and enthusiast) with a knack for learning and creating engaging web experiences. I have a Bachelor of Science from MTSU, and in December 2022, earned my Professional Certificate in Full Stack Development w/ MERN through an MIT Bootcamp. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked as a freelance developer and SEO engineerâ€” but my interest has always been in working on larger-scale, cohesive projects in a collaborative setting. I  am fully dedicated to growing as a developer and learning as much as I can along the way. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m seeking a full-time junior dev role â€” letâ€™s connect and build something together!
